                <p class="slideshow__intro-description">In January 2016, TNHCC (TNH Creative Center) debuted “Traditional Chinese Characters” as the annual theme. Traditional Chinese is only still being used among a few Mandarin-speaking places worldwide, and we must take it upon ourselves to conserve and continue this symbolic culture of Taiwan. In the 60-day pop-up exhibition, TNHCC explored Traditional Chinese characters with three main sections: the “Traditional Chinese Character Museum” which looked into the evolution of the character styles since the 1970s; the “Story Index” which preserves daily cultural stories, and the “Project Lab” where new ways to interact with the characters were explored. By looking into the past, present and future of the Traditional Chinese characters, TNHCC hopes to arouse our memories and connect to our cultural identity.

                <p class="slideshow__intro-description"> I was responsible for the content planning. I participated in designing an interactive installation with Merlin Beard Lab, an air calligraphy machine that can write text by sensing hands. The most challenging part of the device was controlling the path of the brush to dip into the ink. The initial setting will cause too much ink to drip on the Spring Festival couplets only after continuous attempts to simulate the set of people using ink pens. In addition, I also work with the last remaining casting type Ri Xing Type Foundry, to present different faces of traditional Chinese characters and plan workshops for visitors. Most encouragingly, the project was recognized by Red Dot Design Award and Taipei International Design Award.
