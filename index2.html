                <p class="slideshow__intro-description">In January 2016, TNHCC (TNH Creative Center) debuted “Traditional Chinese Characters” as the annual theme. Traditional Chinese is only still being used among a few Mandarin-speaking places worldwide, and we must take it upon ourselves to conserve and continue this symbolic culture of Taiwan. In the 60-day pop-up exhibition, TNHCC explored Traditional Chinese characters with three main sections: the “Traditional Chinese Character Museum” which looked into the evolution of the character styles since the 1970s; the “Story Index” which preserves daily cultural stories, and the “Project Lab” where new ways to interact with the characters were explored. By looking into the past, present and future of the Traditional Chinese characters, TNHCC hopes to arouse our memories and connect to our cultural identity.

                <p class="slideshow__intro-description"> I am in charge of content planning for the exhibition. The main task is to show how the traditional Chinese characters are interestingly applied to small things in our life by cooperating with different local studios. My favorite part is the last exhibition area ''Project Lab'', which aims to hope that the audience can have some interesting interaction with the content of the exhibition before leaving. Since the exhibition was scheduled for the Chinese New Year period in Taiwan, we cooperated with Merlin's Mustache Lab to create an installation called "Air Calligraphy" that can turn deliberate hand movements into calligraphy on paper as a spring couplet. After observing the exhibition, I realized that any simple interactive device is the best communication with a minor threshold.
