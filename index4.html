                <p class="slideshow__intro-description">For the annual theme in 2018, TNHCC chose yet another common cultural aspect of our daily lives “Popular Music”. We believe that music creations are deeply influenced by the living experiences of different decades, and the common cultural memories shared at the time will be shaped into popular trends. 
                </p>
                <p class="slideshow__intro-description"> I was responsible for the background analysis of the exhibition and the opening party. In the analysis part, my colleagues and I have done a lot of research on the history of Taiwanese music development. We also visited many well-known Taiwanese producers. Interestingly, in one meeting, each participant was of a different age group, and the popular music in their memory was also different. This moment just inspired us to set up each room which represents a different era. When you walk in, you will know the life of that era through the songs and lyrics. What touched me is that parents and children trying to understand culture background respective through popular music. In the part of the opening party, I arranged the entire rundown and partners. Considering the shy personality of the Taiwanese, I planned three tasks for the guests. First, there is a projected image at the entrance where guests can pretend to hold a microphone to take a photo and share it on social media. Second, we set up a "Memories Karaoke" at the end of the exhibition. Record the karaoke song by the audience into cassette tapes as souvenirs. Third, we designed a psychological test game to get feedback from all visitors.
