                <p class="slideshow__intro-description">For the annual theme in 2018, TNHCC chose yet another common cultural aspect of our daily lives --- “Popular Music”. We believe that music creations are deeply influenced by the living experiences of different decades, and the common cultural memories shared at the time will be shaped into popular trends. By comparing music characteristics in different generations, and glimpsing into how social moods are communicated using music, TNHCC looked into why popular music is seen as a medium that reflects the time and cultural shifts and explored the cultural identification of this generation.

                <p class="slideshow__intro-description"> Here's what I did in this project: I was in charge of the background analysis of the exhibition and the opening party. In the analysis part, my colleagues and I have done a lot of research on the history of Taiwanese music development. We also visited many well-known Taiwanese producers. Interestingly, in one meeting, each participant was of a different age group, and the popular music in their memory was also different. This just inspired us to plan the exhibition into different rooms. Each room represents a different era. When you walk in, you will know the life of that era through the songs and lyrics. What moved me the most is that parents and children know each other's favorite songs and understand each other through music.
